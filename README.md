This game represent an modified packman game .

the mean idea to play a new version of packman game that i have developed while studying.

all the game has been devloped in java, using Eclipse workspace.

# About The Game
first you need to know who is the players in the game:
* Packman : the packman is the only character the can play with, in every game there is only one packman.
* Fruit : the fruit is unmoved object that the packman can eat and increase it score, the number of the fruits is specific before starting the game, once there is no fruits the game will end.
* Ghost : the gost follow the packman and want to eat them, in case that it catch the packman the score will decrease, also it can eat the frut.
* Box : the boxes in this game reflects walls, and cannot been touched, once the packman touch the wall his score will decrease.

The game phrase a packman player, fruit, Ghosts and some walls(boxes) on Ariel map, that run togather, the player only can move the packman using up, down, left, right keys,
the Goal of this game is geting more score.

The player will initialize the game, he can build and new map or use Exist one.

There is bar upside that will help you to add more fruits, ghosts and box, also there is option to load exist game or save your game to share with others.

The player need to run from the ghost without touchung the walls, and he need to collect the fruits to get more score.

All the game the ghost will run after the packman and try to catch them.

At the end of the game the score that been got will be show in the scren, also it will be saved in database to make some challenge between the players.
